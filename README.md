•	Game Concept: What's your RPG world about?
My game concept is to create a rogue-like RPG in which the player is able to explore the world, choose a class, go into dungeons and fight enemies to level up, eventually reaching the final boss.
•	Design Choices: Why did you choose your stat formulas?
I choose these stat formulas to because they would be easy for me to understand, while also accomplishing what I wanted in my stat system. Its a simple design that takes base values and gradually adds onto them as a player progresses.
•	Bonus Creative Features: Did you add anything unique?
I added a character backstory, unique starting equipment, a gold system, a way for the player to level up and progress and unique class abilities.
•	AI Usage: What AI assistance did you use and where?
AI was used to help create this program. Originally, my plan was to create a simple game with not many mechanics, however I received some ideas that I felt were good to implement after asking the AI to look over my code for debugging. This resulting in the AI adding in and developing my character creation coding section and the save and load file features. However the AI used "Try" and "Except" in order to setup the save file function, so I had to go back and modify them to be if else statements, which was a challenge.
•	How to Run: Clear instructions for testing your code
 To run this code, you simply start the program, and I have print commands that will guide the player on what to input to play the game properly.
